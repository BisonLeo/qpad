A 10GB file runs just as fast once it finishes loading.\r\n\r\n**Beautiful.** QPad renders text at PDF-reader-like quality with all the fancy effects: antialiasing, gamma correction, sub-pixel placement, high-DPI support.\r\n\r\n**Straightforward.** Powerful features can be accessed without writing arcane regexps or learning a scripting language.\r\n\r\n### Feature List\r\n\r\nWill write up later after setting up pages.\r\n\r\n",
