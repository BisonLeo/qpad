# Example Help Document

## Feature Test

Markdown supports **bold** and `code=function{return 1+2;}` and *emph*. We automatically fix the "quotes" and 'single-quotes'. But when we can't, we leave them in place.

We can insert images:
![](c:/tp/pure/mo/icon256.png)

And horizontal rules
---
Or CJK: あいうえお

## Another Section

Sections are auto-numbered.

We can insert code:
```js
//javascript highlighting
function(){
	return 0;
}
```

List:
- List items have bullets
- It still supports **bold** and `code=function{return 1+2;}` and *emph*. We automatically fix the "quotes" and 'single-quotes'. But when we can't, we leave them in place.
- Unicode bullets
