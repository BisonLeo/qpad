# QPad Text Editor

**Fast.** A 10MB file won't feel any different than a 10KB file. A 10GB file runs just as fast once it finishes loading.

**Beautiful.** QPad renders text at PDF-reader-like quality and provides visual hints using slick animation.

**Straightforward.** Powerful features can be accessed without writing arcane regexps or learning a scripting language.
