# QPad Text Editor

*Fast.* A 10MB file won't feel any different than a 10KB file. A 10GB file runs just as fast once it finishes loading.

*Beautiful.* QPad renders text at PDF-reader-like quality with all the fancy effects: antialiasing, gamma correction, sub-pixel placement, high-DPI support.

*Straightforward.* Powerful features can be accessed without writing arcane regexps or learning a scripting language.
